We provide pre-built MicroPython images which include all the libraries and drivers you'll need to get started with PicoVision. To install MicroPython, you'll need to **copy the appropriate .uf2 file from the releases page to your device while it's in DFU/bootloader mode.**

## Which file to download?

On the releases page you'll find two .uf2 files. A widescreen and a regular build of the PicoVision firmware.

- [Releases page](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-picovision/releases)

| Build                                                     | .uf2 File                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal resolutions, up to 80 sprites.                     | pimoroni-picovision-vX.X.X-micropython.uf2            |
| Widescreen (max 1280x720†) resolutions, up to 32 sprites. | pimoroni-picovision-widescreen-vX.X.X-micropython.uf2 | 

* † @ 30Hz, limited support on displays

## Entering DFU/bootloader mode

With your PicoVision plugged into your computer, just **hold down the BOOTSEL button and tap RESET**. A new drive should pop up on your computer called 'RPI_RP2'.

## Copying the firmware to your PicoVision

**Copy the downloaded firmware image across to the 'RPI-RP2' drive**. Once it has finished uploading (which takes a few seconds) the board will restart itself.

⚠ Note that once your board restarts running MicroPython it will no longer show up as a drive. To program it and to transfer files to and from it you'll need to use an interpreter, such as Thonny or Mu.

- [Download Thonny](https://thonny.org/)
- [Download Mu](https://codewith.mu/)

You can also transfer files to boards running MicroPython using command line tools, like `mpremote`.
